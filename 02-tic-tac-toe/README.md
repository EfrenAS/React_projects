This is a Tic Tac Toe game built with React.

# Contents

In this project, you will learn how to:

- Create a React project
- Use React components
- Use CSS styles
- Use JSX syntax
- Use React state and props to manage data
- Use React Hooks to manage state (useState and useEffect)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EfrenAS/react-tic-tac-toe.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

## Notes

- On React the state update is asynchronous.
- The initialitation of component when we are using the useState hook only initializes the state when the component is first rendered.
- All hooks cannot be called inside of a conditional statement or inside a loop.
